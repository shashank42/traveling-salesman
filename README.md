==================

Python algorithms for the traveling salesman problem

Contains a branch & bound algorithm and a over-under genetic algorithm.

Both use the TSP files in the repo.

To run the branch & bound, run the TSP.py file with eil51.tsp in the folder. (Warning this will take a while).

To run the genetic algorithm, run the Genetic.py file with eil51.tsp in the folder.

Other .tsp files can be used by changing the file name in the .py files.

For Artificial Intelligence class.
